# advanced-data-structures-class-projects
repository containing projects created for advanced data structures class

nothing insane, one of the more impressive projects here will be the 'Semester_Project'

Semester project contains a program that reads temperature data from 5 files under "temperature generator for files"
These are a list of 5 temperatures generated by a random program to then use in the semester project. 
All temperatures are based on average temperatures around Newton Ks (plus minus 5? i think? its been a while since ive looked through it)
If you do not desire to use files then the semester project program will make up the new temeratures for you. 

The program then uses these temperatures to show you the highlights of the year, such as hot, cold, hottest stretch of days, coldest stretch of days.
The program then shows graphs of the data given and 'predicts' the next years temps based on data from the previous 5 years. (by only taking the average so nothing crazy)

better sorts could have been used.
