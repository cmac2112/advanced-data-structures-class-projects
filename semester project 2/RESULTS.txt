Results:

The results from this project are good.

Everything works as intended and every bug i encountered was fixed.
However, tensorflow was not implemented mostly because of complexity and time constraints. 
Whether i had some values wrong or my computer is just that slow (which it is not) it took 
this program 3 hours to spit out 365 predicted temperatures. Decided to scrap it after that night.

Taking averages over tensorflow probably would not change the outcome in such as small program.
And it probably would not affect the validity of these predicted results. Like i said before
due to the chaos theory, no one knows exactly how the weather will behave in 3 days time.
