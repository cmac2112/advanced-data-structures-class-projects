Development log for this project

3/14/2023: Implemented randomizer generator for the 5 random years option
3/15/2023: Played around with tensorflow to get a feel, training and predicting took too long
for a class presentation, scrapped tensorflow in favor of averages
3/30/2023: Implemented hottest/coldest temp of selected years and its accompaniying funcitons
(such as sorting)
4/10/2023: implemented warmest/coldest stretch of temps with the help of the internet. 
Also implemented tkinter and file import, fixed bugs with importing files such as all
elements importing with'\n' because all elements were being imported as strings
implemented plotting functions
4/11/2023: fixed bug with elements being imported as strings, added repective function convert
4/30/2023:Implemented predicting function, and modified existing plotting functions to 
plot new found predicted year.
5/1/2023: fixed bug when user would find the warmest and coldest temp (which sorted the list),
to not be sorted once again when going to plotting second by creating copies of the list to
be stored in a sepertate variable before sorting.
5/2/2023: final touches on print statements and making coding more readable
5/3/2023: done
