Goals for project

a program than can realatively predict next years temps possibly using ai (tensorflow)

1. choice to randomize or import files
2. find the warmest/coldest temps from selected year
3. find the warmest/coldest stretch of 7 days and find the mean temp, temps for those 7 days,
and the day it started on
4. plot temperatures using line and scatter plot.

5. use tensorflow/averages to 'predict' next years temps
6. find the warmest/coldest day predicted
7. compare plots with given data

extra:
1. Use tkinter to import files in a dialoge box
