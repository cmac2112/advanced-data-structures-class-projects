Enclosed is a program that will take 5 years of temperature data and try and predict
the next years temperatures based off of those 5 previous years. 

It does this by taking the average from each index in the list of temperatures and stores
them in its own list for the predicted year. Originally this was done with a tensorflow
trained ai, but running this would take too long for a small presentaion. 

Originally tensorflow was working, but due to time and bugs, tensorflow was replaced in favor
of averages. While not totally accurrate, it reflects the real world due to chaos theory. 
Chaos theory being that, you cant account for every variable in predicting, once one vairable is
off in your model, the wrogness of the model grows exponentially. In other words, no one knows
exactly what they weather will be like in 3 days...

When you open the program you are faced with either randomizing 5 years of temperatures (based
on highs and lows of Newton ks) or importing your own files. Enclosed are the temperature
files i used for testing (temp1, temp2, temp3, temp4, temp5). Be sure to click on them in order
of year when entering them through the box. These test files were also randomly generated using
another python program.

The rest of the program is self explanatory, such as finding hottest and coldest temps,
lowest and highest means of temps over a given week, and the plots that are encoded to give
a visual representation of the climate.
